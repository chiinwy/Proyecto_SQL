On this proyect we need to create a database for a blockbuster. 

We are given old tables on csv from a blocbuster. On this proyect, we need to clean the 7 csv and upload each one of them to the databse so we can have a functioning database for the opening of the new blockbuster.

We need to create a database on sql so que can upload the files and create the database so the blockbuster is functional.

Here we have some directories, one containing the jupyter notebook where we clean the csv, the data directory where we have the old and cleaned csv, and the sql directory where we have the queries for the database
