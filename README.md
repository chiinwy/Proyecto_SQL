On this proyect we need to create a database on sql for the opening blockbuster. We are given old csv from the last day of the blockbuster before they close.

So, we need to create a database on sql, establishing the relations between the tables, so we can use the old films and inventory to open the blockbuster and keep adding the new films with new actors.
